# Morse Translator

Developing a Program That Can Encrypt Characters and Decrypt Morse Code Using Core Python Programming

This main objective of the program is to be able to collect input from the user, asking him which language he / she would like to enter in, and the program automatically then converts it into the other language and displays the translated message on the screen. 

The process involved in converting from english to morse code will, from here on, be termed as encryption and for the process involved in converting morse code to human understandable english alphabets to be termed as decryption.
